# Elementary graph algorithms
This package is not ready yet.
I've been implementing those algorithms in Python as I learn them in Graph Algorithms subject at college.


### What we have by now:
- Breadth-First Search
- Deep-First Search
- Topological Sort
- Strongly Connected Components algorithm
- Graph structure
- Vertice structure
- Some graph samples
- Kruskal algorithm for minimum spanning trees
- Prim algorithm for minimum spanning trees
- Some other functions


### In progress:
- Proper readme file (full description of the project)
- Package documentation (how to use and more details)
- More samples
- Samples images (it will be helpful to visualize the graphs)
- More functions




<br/><br/>
> All the knowledge and samples was taken from/based on the book <b>"Introduction to Algorithms"</b> by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest and Clifford Stein
