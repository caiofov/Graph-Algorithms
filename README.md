# Elementary graph algorithms
This package is not ready yet.
I've been implementing those algorithms in Python as I learn them in Graph Algorithms subject at college.


### What we have by now:
- Breadth-First Search
- Deep-First Search
- Graph structure
- Vertice structure
- Some graph samples


### In progress:
- Proper readme file (full description)
- Package documentation
- More samples
- Samples images
- Source copyrights

> All the knowledge and samples was taken from/based on the book <b>"Introduction to Algorithms"</b> by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest and Clifford Stein
